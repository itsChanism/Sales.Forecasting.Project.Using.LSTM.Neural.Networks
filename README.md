# Sales.Forecasting.Project.Using.LSTM.Neural.Networks
Background and Objective:
In this project, I was tasked with developing a predictive model to forecast future sales data for multiple products. Leveraging historical sales information, I aimed to predict future trends using advanced machine learning techniques to aid in inventory management and financial planning.

·Developed and implemented a time series forecasting model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks,feed foreard neural networks specifically tailored to capture temporal dependencies in sales data.
·Utilized a "look back" mechanism to transform the sequential data into a supervised learning problem, determining how many previous time steps were used to predict subsequent sales.
·Performed extensive data preprocessing, including data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering, ensuring the quality and relevance of the input data.
·Created real-time forecasts for the next 20% of the time series, using 80% of the data for training, and applied a rolling-forecast strategy for accurate predictions.
·Evaluated the model's accuracy through Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and visualized the actual vs. predicted sales data for transparent performance analysis.
·Engineered the model to be customizable, with adjustable parameters such as the look-back period and prediction size, making it adaptable to various business scenarios.
·This project resulted in a robust and adaptable forecasting tool capable of providing accurate sales predictions. I honed my skills in time series analysis, deep learning, and data visualization, gaining hands-on experience with Python, TensorFlow/Keras, pandas, and Matplotlib. This project offered valuable insights into sales trend analysis and its applications in business strategy
